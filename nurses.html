      <p>For many nurses that have spent a portion of their careers in the operating room, we know there are a number of phyisicans that you would trust with your own care. However, as with any profession, there are some amazing surgeons, those that have perfected their skills and uphold the highest patient safety standards, but also those whose abilities, at times, are questionable at best. 
        <br><br> Using the form below, please find and rate a provider that you have extensive professional experience with. Do not base this rating off of personal relationships, bedside manner, or any other quality other than skill set alone. We want patients to use this knowledge to make informed decisions for the best possible outcomes during a very vulnerable time.
        <br><br> If you do not see a physician that you work with, please go to the Contact page and fill out a form to submit the name of another provider you would like added to the site. We are dedicated to inluding any and all surgeons that nurses want to review to provide insight to help patients make the best choice for their care.</p>
