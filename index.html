      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <p>Nurses Know was conceived from the idea that nurses have an insider knowledge about physician performace. Although many patients are able to read reviews of providers from other websites based on similar patients' experiences, only those that work with them in the operating room can know the true standard of care they provide. The purpose of Nurses Know is to allow patients an insider look behind the drapes of the surgical suite and provide them the kinds of insights that only nurses know.</p>

      <h2>For Nurses</h2>
      <p>Utilizing your nursing expertise, let patients know which providers you would choose for your own surgical care. These ratings should be based on your observations of physicians' strengths and weaknesses after working side-by-side with them over the course of your career. This is your opportunity to highlight the providers that provide phenomenal care, as well as those whose care is subpar.</p>

      <h2>For Patients</h2>
      <p>Use nursing knowledge to your advantage by identifying surgeons that nurses would entrust with their own medical needs or the needs of their families. By sharing their experiences, nurses will help you make more informed decisions about your surgical care. Search by specialty to find the provider that is right for you!</p>
